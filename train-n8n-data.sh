# LLM Project
This project aims to build industry specific LLMs that are smaller models but trained on latest dataset so that they may be able to perform at the same levels of larger models with much less computing power and greater accuracy.

LLMs contain lot of information, quantization, in essence scales down the model.  This may be data relating to various fields, however when they are designed for an industry or a specific area of specialization, we need to create purpose driven LLMs.  

The Industry applications can vary but the fact remains that the LLMs in most cases is a jack of all trades, and needs special training to be affluent in current industry standards, this means a continuous learning process is required. If you take up any llm today from any major vendors that are opensource, we find the training data is probably one or two years behind. 

Some industries may need to focus on adding most relevant approach and removing detailed old methods (managed self deprecation) of knowledge base, while others may use specialized systems that may perform the functions through an agent, MCP or another system that is vastly more capable of the specific task.

Though this is cuirrently setup to create improved software development models, we hope that others could pitch in to help collect sources and data relevant to training models for other industries over time.

##Approach
    - Identify the LLM model that is conversationally viable for implementation for the task.
    - Focus based on understanding, thinking or industry is the key selection criteria.
    - Build a plan for the required knowledgebase and training dataset.
    - Test dataset and check for errors or conflicts
    - Train the selected model
    - Measure peformace with low, medium and high complexity tasks against an industry leader LLM.
    - Store performace records, improve training records, incrementally measure peformance. 

##Planned Model
    - Resources 
        - Online Resources (ETL latest industry data)
        - Prepared Datasets   (Cleaned Data ready for training)

    - LLM
        - Datacards (Industry specific datacards)
        - Purpose Built Models (Fine tuned models)

    - Build Cycle
        - Load Actions: Action plan for weekly or monthly orchestrated data collection
        - Nightly Task:  Action plan to clean and build dataset for each industry and relevance
        - Build Plan: Action plan for retraining of models based on knowledge base training delta.
